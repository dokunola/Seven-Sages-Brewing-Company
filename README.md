# **Create a Data Model for Seven Sages Brewing Company**

## Project Description:
The goal is to manage the datasets and develop an effective data model for a small brewing company so they can better understand which products are profitable and popular. This will enable them to make wise decisions about which items to prioritize as the business expands.
The project shows an understanding of fundamental data modeling concepts, including the ability to clean, organize, and structure data in Power Query, create a date table, build a data model with the proper relationships and filters, and produce a straightforward report using widely used visualizations and DAX measures.
